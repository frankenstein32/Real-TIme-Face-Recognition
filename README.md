# OpenCV
Face detection using Opencv and Python
OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.The Library provides more than 2500 algorithms that include machine learning tools for classification and clustering, image processing and vision algorithm, basic algorithms and drawing functions, GUI and I/O functions for images and videos. Some applications of these algorithms include face detection, object recognition, extracting 3D models, image processing, camera calibration, motion analysis etc.

# Face Detection
Face detection has gained a lot of attention due to its real-time applications. A lot of research has been done and still going on for improved and fast implementation of the face detection algorithm. Why is face detection difficult for a machine? Face detection is not as easy as it seems due to lots of variations of image appearance, such as pose variation (front, non-front), occlusion, image orientation, illumination changes and facial expression.

OpenCV contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc.

 For face detection specifically, there are two pre-trained classifiers:I have implemented the haarcascade classifier.
 
 # Face Recognition
 Using the above method the data of the detected face gets stored in the data folder in the same directory as that of the dectection code.Then one can use multiple Classification algorthms to recognize and predict the name of the user.
 
 I have used KNN Algorihm for classification.
 
 ## Wait it's Not Over yet,
 Currently, the accuracy of the algorithm is not so good but i am working on the Algorithm to increase it's accuracy and will be updated soon. :)
